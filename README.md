# Kitgrid

Personal docs network for my own projects. It aggregates documentation from multiple repos, pulling raw Markdown with `pnpm docs:fetch` and normalizing metadata along the way. Those docs are then compiled into a shared documentation hub (plus per-project microsites), so any project that ships a docs folder automatically shows up in one place.
